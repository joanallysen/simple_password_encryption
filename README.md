# Simple Password Encryption

## Brief Description
How this work is that the function is going to create a new key based on the total of ascii number in the password, after that each character will be added with the key in the password, shifting the alphabet by a little bit.
This method is fairly simple and is really weak, with brute force trying to add each character with every possible key, password can be accessed only with 256 tries.

Feel free to look at the code!
